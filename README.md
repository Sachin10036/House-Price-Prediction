#House Price Prediction

Introduction:

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for estimating house prices using machine learning algorithms. Accurate house price prediction is crucial for various stakeholders in the real estate industry, including buyers, sellers, and investors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights for informed decision-making and market analysis.


Methodology:

Importing Dependencies: We import essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and XGBoost to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and model implementation.

Importing the Boston House Price Dataset: The Boston house price dataset is loaded from a CSV file using Pandas DataFrame. Initial data exploration steps include checking dimensions, handling missing values, and computing statistical measures.

Understanding Feature Correlation: We explore the correlation between different features using Seaborn's heatmap, identifying relationships between variables.

Splitting Data and Target: The dataset is split into features (X) and the target variable (Y), preparing the data for model training and testing.

Model Training: XGBoost Regressor: We train the predictive model using the XGBoost Regressor algorithm, known for its efficiency and performance in regression tasks.

Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared error and Mean Absolute Error. Visualizations, such as scatter plots, are generated to compare actual house prices with predicted prices.
Building a Predictive Model: The trained model's functionality is demonstrated by providing predictions for sample input representing house features.

Results:

After following the outlined methodology, we successfully developed and evaluated a predictive model for house price estimation. The model demonstrated promising performance in accurately predicting house prices based on their attributes.


Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project achieved its objective of developing an accurate predictive model for house price estimation using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the Boston house price dataset and the XGBoost Regressor algorithm, we created a reliable tool for predicting house prices, thus aiding decision-making processes in the real estate market.
